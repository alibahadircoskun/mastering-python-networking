# Network Automation Journey with Python

This repository documents my hands-on journey through a modern network automation and programmability workflow using Python and real lab environments.

I am working chapter by chapter through the book Mastering Python Networking by Eric Chou and turning each topic into practical labs, scripts, and automation projects. The goal is not just to read concepts, but to apply them in realistic network scenarios similar to what engineers face in production environments.

Each chapter contains:

- Working automation scripts or labs  
- Clear documentation of what was built  
- Real-world relevance and lessons learned  

This repository serves as both a learning log and a practical portfolio of network engineering and automation skills.

## Goals of This Project

- Build strong foundations in Python for networking  
- Automate network device interactions  
- Use APIs and intent-based automation tools  
- Apply Ansible in production-style structures  
- Work with containers and modern lab environments  
- Explore monitoring, security, cloud networking, CI/CD, and testing  
- Document everything clearly and professionally
